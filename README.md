# Simple Todo App

This app allows the user to set up a digital todo list, accompanied by deadlines that are chosen when a new item is added to the list. After an item is completed, you can experience the wave of relief when finally get to delete the task off the list!

## Functionality

With a heavy emphasis on javascript, this app is working with 2 files doing the work: FormValidation.js and Todo.js. The former is tasked with validating the inputs the user makes on the "Todo" creation form, anything not within the parameters set by the HTML Elements will not be permitted. The latter is charged with the creation of new "Todo" items on the list, with the help of the HTML template. Both are then exported to the main index.js.

## Technology

The practices of OOP coding are highlighted in both of the aforementioned js files. The original code for the Todo class in Todo.js was outlined with a function forward focus in index.js, and the FormValidator class was made in a seperate script then applied directly to the HTML file.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:

FOR REVIEWER:
I am stuck trying to figure out how to get my popup to close properly and how to get the Todo count functionality corrected. I would very much appreciate a step in the right direction for those 2 problems as I have already posted in the hub and rewatched the walkthrough twice.
